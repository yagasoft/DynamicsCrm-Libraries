      Improved: helpers for easier usage
      * 5.3.3
      Added: proper warm up logic for all pooling levels
      Fixed: internal pool initialisation
      Fixed: timeout configuration
      Fixed: disposal state

      Added: connection timeout parameter
      * 5.1.4

      Added: exposed AutoSetMaxPerformanceParams through the pool 'helper' class
      Improved: optimised the interfaces and refactored
      Improved: internal calls by switching them to pass through service features
      Changed: tighten the service validity check to avoid internal operations triggering after Dispose; user must wait for all operations to finish
      Fixed: params default values
      Removed: async operations (use Task.Run or similar methods from .NET instead)
      * 4.1.1
      Added: CacheItemPriority to cache settings
      Improved: pool helpers
      Improved: generics and refactored

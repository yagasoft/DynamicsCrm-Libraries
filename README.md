### Version: 8.1.1
---

A collection of libraries for common and extended operations in Dynamics CRM development that gives power to the developer and saves time.

## Features

### Common Library

  + Massive JS and CS libraries of common and generic functions and classes
    + [CRM Logger](https://github.com/yagasoft/DynamicsCrm-CrmLogger)
    + [CRM Text Parser](https://github.com/yagasoft/Dynamics365-CrmTextParser)

### Enhanced Organisation Service library

  + An extension to the out-of-the-box IOrganizationService
  + Automatic service pool handling (core feature)
  + Connection warmup to improve initialisation performance (optional)
  + Caching of operation results (optional)
  + Automatic retry of failed operations (optional)
  + Operation events and statistics
  + Load balancer algorithms for multi-node environments
  + In-memory transactions
  + Deferred operations to run in a transaction
    + Accumulate operations from across the application to be executed in one go
  + Planned execution to be sent to CRM for execution
    + Return values from mid-execution operations can be used in later operations within the same transaction
